        <div class="about">
        <p>I am a Minneapolis based graphic designer who is specialized in editorial design and user experience design.<br></br> I was born and raised in Beijing, China. Living in a family of art and design made me exposed to this field quite early. However, I was not raised to be an artist that I hadn't been in one of the drawing class or sculpture class. I was thinking I chould be a scientist or an engineer.<br></br>The turning point happened in college when I was rethinking what should I do in the future. The world of science seemed really strange to me that none of the people around me was in this realm and at the same time I was also mentally fragile for coming to a brand new space.<br></br>So I took the design classes in the university. Although I haven't been trained before, I can build up the ideas and concepts in differnet designs easily and I also feel more pleased to think creatively breaking the boundaries. <br></br> Here I come. </p>
